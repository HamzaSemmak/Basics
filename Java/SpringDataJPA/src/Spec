Exercise: Building a Simple Spring Data JPA Application

Scenario:
Imagine you are building a bookstore application.
You need to create a Spring Boot application that manages information about books.
Each book has an ISBN (International Standard Book Number), a title, an author, and a publication year.

Requirements:
Create a new Spring Boot project using your favorite IDE or Spring Initializer.
Add the necessary dependencies, including Spring Data JPA and an H2 in-memory database.

Define a Book entity class with the following attributes:
id (auto-generated)
isbn (string)
title (string)
author (string)
publicationYear (integer)
Create a BookRepository interface that extends JpaRepository<Book, Long>. This repository interface will provide CRUD operations for the Book entity.
Implement a RESTful API with the following endpoints using Spring MVC:

GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
GET /books/{id}: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
POST /books: Create a new book.
PUT /books/{id}: Update an existing book.
DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a book by its ID.
Implement validation for book attributes:

Ensure that the ISBN is unique.
Add validation constraints for other fields as appropriate (e.g., title should not be empty).
Write unit tests for your application using JUnit and Spring Test.

Use Postman or a similar tool to test your REST API endpoints by performing CRUD operations on books.

Add error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes to your API responses.

Hints:

Use annotations such as @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, and @Column to define the Book entity and its attributes.

Use @RepositoryRestResource on the repository interface to enable Spring Data REST endpoints automatically,
 or create custom controllers for more fine-grained control.

Implement validation constraints using annotations like @NotBlank, @Size, and @UniqueConstraint.

For database initialization, you can use data.sql and schema.sql files or set properties in your application.properties
or application.yml for an H2 in-memory database.

Use the @RestController annotation to create a RESTful controller class.

For unit testing, use Spring Boot's @SpringBootTest and @AutoConfigureMockMvc annotations to set up a test environment.

Handle exceptions using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.

Don't forget to configure your database connection details in your application.properties or application.yml file.

This exercise will help you practice creating a simple Spring Boot application with Spring Data JPA, implementing RESTful
APIs, handling validation and error cases, and writing unit tests. It's a valuable exercise for learning Spring Data
JPA and building web applications with Spring Boot.
