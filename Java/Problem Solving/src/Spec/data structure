Description: Implement basic operations for a singly linked list, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Solve problems like reversing the linked list.

 - Binary Tree Traversal:
Description: Write Java programs to traverse binary trees using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal techniques.

 - Binary Search Tree (BST):
Description: Create a binary search tree data structure with methods to insert, delete,
and search for elements, maintaining the properties of a BST.

 - Hash Table:
Description: Implement a hash table data structure and use it to solve problems like finding duplicate
elements in an array or storing key-value pairs.

 - Graph Representation:
Description: Design a graph data structure with methods to add vertices and edges.
Use it to solve graph-related problems, like finding a path between two nodes or performing graph traversals.

 - Priority Queue:
Description: Implement a priority queue using a binary heap data structure.
Use it for tasks like finding the kth largest or smallest element in an array efficiently.

 - Trie (Prefix Tree):
Description: Build a trie data structure that stores words efficiently.
Use it to search for words in a dictionary or implement autocomplete functionality.

 - Linked List Cycle Detection:
Description: Write a program to detect cycles in a linked list using Floyd's algorithm,
which uses two pointers to traverse the list.

Description: Implement depth-first search, a graph traversal algorithm, to explore and solve problems
on graphs and trees.

 - Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Description: Write Java programs that use breadth-first search to explore and solve problems
on graphs and trees by visiting nodes level by level.

 - Heap Sort:
Description: Implement the heap sort algorithm to sort an array in place using a max-heap or min-heap data structure.
 - Red-Black Tree:
Description: Create a red-black tree data structure, which is a self-balancing binary search tree.
Implement insertion and deletion operations to maintain its properties.

 - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree):
Description: Implement a Fenwick tree data structure, which efficiently computes prefix sums and updates ranges of values in an array.

 - LRU Cache:
Description: Design an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using data structures like a hash map and
a doubly linked list to efficiently manage a cache with limited capacity.

Trie-Based Search Engine:
